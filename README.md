# Exercise Project - Developer Profile

In this mini fullstack project we want to build a developer profile with form validation & avatar uploads step-by-step.

In the frontend we will perform the form building and validation with the Formik library.

In the backend we will provide an avatar image upload with the Multer library.

Please take a look at the TASK files for your instructions.
